🎓I am a 12th grade student from SMKN 3 Depok

👨🏻‍💻My interest in IT is quite high, especially in the field of Cloud engineer and DevOps engineer.

✨besides that I also have a strong interest in other IT fields, such as the world of programming, networking, and cybersecurity. In addition, I am also interested in new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) 🤖, Internet of Things (IoT), and how technology can be used to solve everyday problems.

📚I always enjoy learning new things, especially those related to technological developments. My hope is to continue developing my skills in this field and one day contribute to the IT industry professionally.
